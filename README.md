# Haka Website ![](https://haka-website.web.app/assets/haka-32x32.png) <sup><sub>[DEMO](https://haka-website.web.app)</sub></sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An animated portfolio website developed to my parents company using `Imba.js` and `Firebase`. It includes a header, an about section, a services section, a portfolio section - made with `Masonry` library - and a footer/contact section. Also, it's responsive and has an administrador page where you can change the portfolio categories and the job images from each category.

### How to run

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, copy the code below into your terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/LucasSFranco/haka-website
cd haka-website
npm install
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, you must create your own project in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), copy the firebase config and place inside `/haka-website/src/firebase.imba`. Also, create an account in the auth section of your firebase project to have access to the administrador page, available at `/admin` route.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, just type the code below in the terminal and enjoy it.
```
npm run start
```
